# Bok

Bok is a set of programming games. You don't play these games
directly, rather you write programs to play them. Your programs
control creatures in a 2D world, with collisions and gravity and such
like. Join games with others locally or over the network, while you
(optionally) watch the fun.

See:

## Rationale

For fun of course. But also: to test evolution and intelligence
algorithms in a rich-enough problem domain, and compare them to
human-designed solutions.


## Running bouts

Get [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) first.

You can run some in-process demos:

```
cd bok/runner
lein run -m org.nfrac.bok.tests.bipoid sumo
lein run -m org.nfrac.bok.tests.humanoid vortex-maze
lein run -m org.nfrac.bok.tests.wormoid climbly-altitude
lein run -m org.nfrac.bok.tests.bipoid bowl-energy-race
lein run -m org.nfrac.bok.tests.bipoid cavern-hunt
```

Or try running player servers communicating over TCP:

```
cd bok/players/clojure
lein run -m org.nfrac.bok.examples.bipoid1 5555
lein run -m org.nfrac.bok.examples.humanoid1 5556
cd bok/runner
lein run -m org.nfrac.bok.visual-runner sumo tcp://localhost:5555 tcp://localhost:5556
```

Or use the Clojure REPL: see
